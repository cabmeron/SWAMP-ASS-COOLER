Components:


* 1X: LCD 1602 Display
* 4X: Color Leds (Blue, Yellow, Red, Green)
* 2X: Potentiometer
* 1X: Stepper Motor
* 1X: Fan Blade
* 1X: Kit motor
* 1X: DHT11 Temperature / Humidity Sensor
* 1X: Water Sensor
* 1X: External Power Supply
* 3X: Breadboard
* 1X: Push Button
* 4X: 1000 Ohm Resistor
* 1X: 220 Ohm Resistor
* 1X: Arduino ATmega 2560
* MANY WIRES, varying length




Tech Stack:


* C++, Arduino IDE




Constraints:


* Water Level: trigger if water value < 100 (may not be optimal speed)
* Temperature: vary based on environment (set greater than our testing room ( > 24 C)
* Needs external power supply for fan / ATmega 2560
* Fragile components, easily damaged
* Cannot operate is freezing environments / no water (will not survive on Venus either)
* Complicated setup for potential client unless deployed with less hardware exposure

Description:


        LED’s light up relative to cooler state


1. Disabled (yellow)
2. Idle (green)
3. Running (blue)
4. Error (red)




* Gathering temperature and humidity for real-time LCD display
* Potentiometer controls stepper motor
* Fan coupled with external power supply
* Water level Sensor to maintain idle or running states
* ISR() for register manipulation
